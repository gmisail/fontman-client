## What is `fontman`?

`fontman` is a command line-based package manager for fonts.

Installing fonts is either done through clunky user interfaces
*or* manually moving fonts to the correct system folder & regenerating
the font cache.

Package managers like `npm` or `pacman` make it very easy to
install executables & libraries; why is there no package
manager for fonts as well?

## Stack 

### Client

- Go
- urfave/cli (command line framework)
- FontConfig (font management utility)

### Registry

- Go 
- Fiber (web framework)
- SQLite (database)

---

## Organization

For managing repositories, we went with a **polyrepo** approach, i.e. both the client & registry had
separate repositories.

- Client: https://github.com/gmisail/fontman-client
- Registry: https://github.com/gmisail/fontman-registry

For handling "tickets" / issues, we used Github's Issue Tracker; having multiple repositories allowed us
to cleanly manage issues for both projects.

Due to being a small team, we used Discord for communication (in addition to having system architecture 
discussions during class.)

## Progress

### Client
- Interface between Go <=> FontConfig
- Parser for FontConfig output (`fc-list`)
- Initializing `fontman`-specific files & directories
- Font installation
	- from file (`.ttf`, `.otf`, ...)
	- from remote (i.e. `fontman install Inconsolata`)
	- from project file (`fontman.yml`)

### Registry
- Fetching & storing font registry files (id, name, styles)
	- `GET /api/font/<uuid>`, `GET /api/font?name="Menl"`
- Finding fonts with a *similar* name, i.e. "Menl" ==> "Menlo", "Liga Menlo"
- Uploading font registry files
	- `POST /api/font`

## Client

TBD.

## Registry 

TBD.

# Demo

---

## Install from Registry 
```bash
fontman install Inconsolata
```

---

## Install from File 
```bash
fontman install ComicMono.ttf 
```

---

## Install from Project File 
```bash
fontman install 
```

---

## Next Steps

- User authentication
  - Who can upload fonts?
- `upload` command
  - Add uploading from a file, instead of a REST endpoint
- Font analytics
  - Number of downloads, recently updated, etc...
- I know it's a CLI app, but...
  - Visual polish, clean up the interface
  - Rewrite the visuals to use **BubbleTea**, a TUI framework
- Web interface
  - Similar to `npmjs.com` or `aur.archlinux.org`
  - Browse & preview fonts
  - Provide a download command
    - `fontman install <UUID> <UUID> â€¦`
