# fontman-client

Fontman is a font management utility for Linux.

## Building

Fontman uses [Task](https://taskfile.dev/) as a build utility / task runner. Once `task` is installed,
you can build `fontman` by simply running: `task build`. This will produce a binary in the `/bin` directory.

For testing, you can use the `task run` command; this will run a linter, run tests, build and then run the executable.

***Note:*** you can run the linter and test steps separately by running `task lint` and `task test`.

## Installation

TBD.

## Usage
